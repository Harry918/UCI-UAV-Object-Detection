# Shape & Letter Detection

How it works:
-------------
<i>The main function is detect.py; the entire process will begin here</i>
 
<b>Step 1: Shape Region Estimation & Cropping </b>

 <div>
   <p>From detect.py, we call our shape_detector function. This function will be responsible for returning a masked image containing only the regions it believes to contain any shapes</p> 
 </div>
